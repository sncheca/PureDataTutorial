2020.02.13 Pure Data Workshop

What is pure data?

Why is pure data useful
- realtime
- routing
- integration
- multichannel
- networking applications
- all these things make it exellent for prototyping and quick trials
- free

Patch 0: Sin 440
- what is a sin tone?
- what is a dac~? Basics of digital / analog audio
- two modes (edit and run)
- use a set message to control the pitch
- (use a slider to control the set message)

Patch 1: Playing a file
- difference between objects and messages
- difference between control and signal
- what is stereo audio, demonstrate
- pitfalls here

Patch 2: Recording and playing back
- what is an adc~

Patch 3: Sound synthesis
- use the 440SinTone as the starting point
- gain sliders (CAREFUL)
- acknowledge that this isn't how gain works but we're not gonna do dB today
- addition

Patch 4: Multichannel applications. Demo only.
- sound that moves in a circle
- issue with no ramps
- quadrophonic / 5.1

Patch 5: Filtering
- what is a filter, what is lop and hip
- effects must be done to channels individually. Demonstrate unintentional downmix to mono

Patch 6: Crossovers. Demo only. 
- why is this desirable

Patch 7: Routing. Demo only.
- routing (routing can be used without networked messages, but they tend to go hand in hand)
- there are lots of other control structures that I'm not going to go into.

Patch 8: Networking and partner exercise!
- what is UDP, what is OSC
- one partner start/stop the music on other partner's machine
- encourage them to 
1) control volume from another computer
2) modify filters 
3) modify the sound synthesis patch with networked 
4) or anything else!

Other things
-hot vs cold inlet

Other notes about pd: 
Abstractions and subpatches exist
Always check that DSP is on
print is ur friend!
If things are inexplicable, restart pd or delete and remake the object- 
States can be very insecure. Use loadbangs.
